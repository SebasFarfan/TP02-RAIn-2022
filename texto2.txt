In many machine learning applications, available datasets are sometimes incomplete, noisy
or affected by artifacts. In supervised scenarios, it could happen that label information is of
low quality, which includes unbalanced training sets, noisy labels and other problems.
Moreover, in practice, it is very common that available data samples are not enough to derive
useful supervised or unsupervised classifiers. All these issues are commonly referred as the
low-quality data problem. Machine learning researchers and practitioners have been working
on various strategies to correctly handle the low-quality problem in recent years. Far from
being solved, this problem still represents a fundamental and classic challenge in the
artificial intelligence community.
The aim of this Special Issue was to collect novel contributions on machine learning methods
for low-quality datasets, to contribute to the dissemination of new ideas to solve this
challenging problem, and to provide clear examples of application in real scenarios. Despite
the COVID-19 crisis and lockdowns in most countries, this Special Issue attracted great
attention among researchers worldwide. A total number of twenty-one papers were submitted
and fifteen of them were accepted after appropriate revisions. We were pleasantly surprised
by the diversity of nationalities of contributors and the variety of the addressed problems in
applied sciences ranging from medical and health applications through specific industrial
case study examples. The authors of the published papers are from nine countries located in
Europe, America, Africa and Asia.
